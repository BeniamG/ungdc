This files in this folder do not include the PDF files and R notebook that are available in the original Dataverse dataset.**

Included:

 - The dataset contains the United Nations General Debate Corpus (UNGDC) covering the period 1970-2017. 

- There are 7,897 speeches in plain text format (UTF8). Speeches are structured by Year (Session). Each speech is named using the following convention: ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code, followed by the UN Session number, followed by year. E.g. USA_72_2017.txt.

- The collection also contains a file (Speakers_by_session.csv) recording names and posts of speakers in UN General Debates. Note: before 1994 UN records do not identify the posts of all speakers.
